Objectives:
     - transmit real time data to MAX/SC/LiveOSC/ChucK/Java efficiently
     - everything should be possible (ie. send all locations, velocities, etc)
     - easy to use in applications

Design:
     - use OSC message prefixes
     - can use OSC-Select in max to route
     - can overlay processed data (such as step seq notes), to allow easier interfacing to some blocks

OSC Messages from PF (vision tracker)

/pf/started - when PF starts 

/pf/stopped - when PF stops

/pf/frame samp - new frame
     samp - sample number

/pf/update samp t target x y vx vy major minor groupid groupsize channel
	   - update position of target
     samp - sample number
     t - time of sample (elapsed time in seconds since beginning of run)
     target - UID of target
     x,y - position within field in meters
     vx,vy - estimate of velocity in m/s
     major,minor - major/minor axis size in m
     groupid - id number of group
     groupsize - number of people in group
     channel - channel number assigned
     
/pf/leg samp target leg nlegs x y ex ey vx vy evx evy diam sigmadiam leftness 
     samp - sample number 
     target - UID of target
     leg - leg number (1..nlegs)
     nlegs - number of legs target is modeled with (usually 2, but could be 1 if they are inseparable)
     x,y - position within field in m
     sx,sy - standard error of measurement (SEM) of position, in meters 
     vx,vy - estimate of velocity of leg in m/s
     svx,svy - SEM of velocity, in meters/second
     diam - estimated mean diameter of leg
     sigmadiam - estimated sigma (sqrt(variance)) of diameter -- not the SEM, but how much it varies
     leftness - measure of how likely this leg is the left leg based on past movements, <0 is left leg, >0 is right leg

/pf/entry samp t target channel - new target entered PF
     sent before first /pf/update message for that target
     samp - sample number
     t - time of sample (elapsed time in seconds since beginning of run)
     target - UID of target
     channel - channel number assigned

/pf/exit samp t target - target exitted PF
     samp - sample number
     t - time of sample (elapsed time in seconds since beginning of run)
     target - UID of target

/pf/set/parameter value - send value of various parameters
     minx, miny, maxx, maxy - bounds of PF in units
     npeople - number of people currently present

/pf/pass/obj - commands to pass through to another object type


OSC Messages to PF:
/pf/dump - ask PF to send setup

/pf/adddest host port - add destination for data stream

/pf/rmdest host port - remove destination
