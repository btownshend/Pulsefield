CRS OSC Protocol for laser displays
Version 0.1

Objectives:
     - transmit display information to laser display
     - should be possible to display needed geometries
     - allows for laser driver to optimize conversion of figures into points for display
     - easy to use in applications

Design:
     - set of geometric primitives
     - coordinates are all in real space (x,y,z) in meters
          - z=0 is floor
	  - (x,y) origin determined elsewhere (for CRS, by position of LIDAR)


Notes:
     - (x,y) positions are relative to LIDAR sensor;
	(0,1) is 1m directly in front of sensor,
	(1,0) is 1m to the right of sensor (from the sensor's point of view)
     - colors are triplets of float numbers from 0.0-1.0  (red,green,blue)
          - for green animation laser, laser is on if green>0.5, off otherwise

/laser/start - start laser display
/laser/stop - stop laser display
/laser/line x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2 red green blue
/laser/arc cx cy cz x1 y1 z1 deg red green blue
	   - draw an arc
     cx,cy,cz - center of arc
     x1,y1,z1 - initial position on arc	  
     deg - number of degrees to move along arc (360 for full circle)
     red,green,blue - color

/laser/set/style attribute value
		 Set drawing style; applies to all subsequent drawing up until next /laser/update
     attribute - string attribute name
     value - float value for attribute

/laser/update npoints
	      Send current drawing to laser, clear geomtries styles
     npoints - attempt to use this many points in drawing

/laser/set/scanner PPS blankcount
	Set scanner parameters
     PPS - points per second (default: 30000)
     blankstart - points to blank after slewing
     blankend - points to blank before slewing
     colorskew - number of points late that color information takes effect after corresponding points (default: 0)

/ping code - request /ack response with same code
      e.g. app sends '/ping 45' and server will broadcast '/ack 45'
      the code allows app to be sure its getting an answer to the ping it sent

OSC Messages From Laser:
/ack code - response to /ping
     code - same code value as in /ping message
