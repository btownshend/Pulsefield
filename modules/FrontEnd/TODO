- better modeling of velocities
  - currently using instantaneous velocity which varies wildly
  - should use Kalman Filter
  - can then use velocity and its sigma from state and statevar data
- swaplike may be wrong -- see frame 319 -- looks like wrong assignment
- figure out better way to align video with tracking
