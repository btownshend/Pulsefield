osclaser

This program listens on a UDP port for OSC commands from Pulsefield or CRS and renders them on laser scanners connected via an Ether-dream interface.

Installation Instructions:

Prerequisites:
- install XQuartz (the X11 windows server) for graphic output  - download from http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/
- install macports for installing other software on your computer (such as OSC libraries)   -   see http://www.macports.org/install.php
- using macports install some libraries:
  sudo port install liblo
  sudo port install opencv
  sudo port install cairo

With those, you should be able to run osclaser, but let me know if you have any problems.

When you do run it, you can open a command window (or an XQuartz window, since youâ€™ll have that now and its better than command), and type:
     osclaser -help
