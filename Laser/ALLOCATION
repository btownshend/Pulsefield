Allocating composites to lasers:

- for each composite
  - convert to a set of points at standard (e.g. 1cm) resolution with a single blank point for each jump
  - clip to active area bounds
  - all subsequent operations use these points
- for each composite whose shapeID already had a laser assigned
      - unassign if laser is disabled or fracVisible*(1-fracBlocked)< threshold
      - copy points to laser points for assigned ones
- for each composite without a laser assigned
      - assign to a laser based on:
      	       1. laser must be enabled
	       2. order by fracvisible*fracblocked within some fuzz, then by distance within some fuzz, then by least loaded laser
- prune
- optionally, optimize point ordering for each laser (TODO)
- add blanks
- if there are more than max points for a laser, resample it at a wider spacing and redo blanking,


TODO:
-currently using length of laser assignments so far for ordering, could do two passes assigning definite ones first
- short segments (< pointSpacing), such as background, can be deleted by resampling
