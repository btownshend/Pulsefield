Calibration Method

- separate module which sends commands to laser driver
- should be able to calibrate one laser while others are still operating

0.  Overall settings of calibrator
    - extent of active area
    - could read from LIDAR

1.  Take laser off line
    /laser/offline,unit
2.  Load current mapping
    	 - world, laser coords of 4 control points
2.  Draw test pattern using laser absolute coordinates
    /laser/testpattern x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3,x4,y4
    - draws rectangle at maximum extent
    - target points at control points
3.  Interactive nudge to move/update test points, set their world coordinates entering coordinates

Options:  1..4  select control point
    arrows: move laser coords for given control
    's': save current settings
    'l': load settings from file
    'w': prompt for world coords of control point
    'g': switch to world grid mode (regular lines in grid space)
    'c': select laser unit and put into calibration mode
    'r': all lasers in run mode


Command line options:
	-f configname
	-n nlasers	(can get this from laser server -- should match config file)
	-s host:port OSC address of laser server


LIDAR:
Should have an unscaled affine transform (rotation, translation only) for laser coords to map them to positions in room
- could set by specifying two corners of room, use range data to locate
- or just allow rotation to align to grid of room
- or more general
- calibrator can ask for background ranges
